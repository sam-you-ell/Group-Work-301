% Paragraph on why this is relative 
In order to define the Hall Conductivity from the underlying geometry and topology of the system, the geometric phase has to be considered. For the quantum Hall effect, this geometric phase is specifically known as the Berry Phase\footnote{Also known as the Berry Holonomy from the mathematical concept of \textit{Holonomy}}, after it's discovery by Sir Micheal Berry in 1984 \cite{quantal_phase}.
